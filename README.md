# YouTube API

This project aims to create a `Channel` class using object-oriented programming principles, to easily obtain channel and video statistics data of a given YouTube channel.

Check out my Medium article [here](https://medium.com/@earlc.yu/how-to-apply-oop-principles-in-data-engineering-creating-a-class-object-with-the-youtube-api-ceaffabb07bc) where I go through my process step by step.

## Context

I started learning object-oriented programming awhile back and needed to apply what I have learned. Inspired by Thu Vu data analytics' [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D56_Cx36oGY&t=453s) about creating a data portfolio project with the YouTube API, I decided to create a YouTube channel class using OOP principles. 

## Files

```
.gitignore          - list of files/types to exclude in git commits
main.py             - imports and applies the `Channel` class
README.md           - documentation
youtube.py          - contains the logic for the `Channel` class
```
