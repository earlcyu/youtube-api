# YouTube API

This project aims to create a `Channel` class using object-oriented programming principles, to easily obtain channel and video statistics data of a given YouTube channel.

---

## Context

I started learning object-oriented programming awhile back and needed to apply what I have learned. Inspired by Thu Vu data analytics' [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D56_Cx36oGY&t=453s) about creating a data portfolio project with the YouTube API, I decided to create a YouTube channel class using OOP principles.
